# GitHub Setup Complete - ML Ops Assignment 2

## ✅ Repository Successfully Created and Configured

### Repository Information
- **Repository Name**: `mlops-artifact-pipeline`
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/asitjain16/mlops-artifact-pipeline
- **Repository Type**: Public (as required)
- **Setup Method**: Command line (no web upload penalty)

### Branch Structure Created
Following the assignment requirements, the linear branching approach has been implemented:

1. **main** - Initial branch with README only
2. **classification** - Phase 1: Training Pipeline
3. **test** - Phase 2: Testing Framework  
4. **inference** - Phase 3: Multi-Job Inference Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows Triggered

#### 1. Training Workflow (classification branch)
- ✅ Triggered by push to classification branch
- ✅ Runs training script (`src/train.py`)
- ✅ Uploads model artifact (`model_train.pkl`)
- ✅ Workflow file: `.github/workflows/train.yml`

#### 2. Testing Workflow (test branch)
- ✅ Triggered by push to test branch
- ✅ Runs pytest suite (`tests/test_train.py`)
- ✅ Validates all 11 unit tests
- ✅ Workflow file: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

#### 3. Inference Workflow (inference branch)
- ✅ Triggered by push to inference branch
- ✅ Multi-job pipeline with dependencies:
  - **test** job runs first
  - **train** job depends on test (uses `needs: test`)
  - **inference** job depends on train (uses `needs: train`)
- ✅ Artifact passing between jobs
- ✅ Workflow file: `.github/workflows/inference.yml`

## 📊 Expected GitHub Actions Results

- **Artifact Download**: ✅
- **Inference Accuracy**: ~95.83%
- **Workflow Status**: Should pass

## 🔍 How to Monitor GitHub Actions

1. **Visit Repository**: https://github.com/asitjain16/mlops-artifact-pipeline
2. **Check Actions Tab**: Click on "Actions" tab to see workflow runs
