- ✅ Implemented comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_train.py`
- ✅ Configuration validation tests
- ✅ Model creation and fitting tests
- ✅ Accuracy threshold validation
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/test.yml`

### Phase 3: Multi-Job Inference Pipeline (inference branch)

- ✅ Job dependencies using `needs` parameter
- ✅ Artifact passing between jobs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Configuration
```json
{
    "C": 1.0,              // Inverse regularization strength
    "solver": "lbfgs",      // Optimization algorithm
    "max_iter": 1000,       // Maximum iterations
    "random_state": 42,     // Random seed
    "test_size": 0.2        // Test set proportion
}
```

### Dataset and Model
- **Dataset**: sklearn.datasets.load_digits (built-in)
- **Features**: 64 grayscale pixel values (8x8 images)
- **Classes**: 10 digits (0-9)
- **Model**: LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model

### Performance Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 95.83%
- **Test Accuracy**: 95.83%
- **F1-Score**: 95.83%
- **All Unit Tests**: 11/11 passing

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Training Workflow (train.yml)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to `classification` branch
**Steps**:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python 3.9
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. Run training script
5. Upload model artifact

### 2. Testing Workflow (test.yml)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to `test` branch
**Steps**:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python 3.9
3. Install dependencies
4. Run pytest suite

### 3. Inference Workflow (inference.yml)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to `inference` branch
**Jobs with Dependencies**:
1. **test**: Run unit tests
2. **train**: Train model (depends on test)
3. **inference**: Run inference (depends on train)

## Branching Strategy

Following the linear branching approach as specified:
```
main → classification → test → inference
```

Each branch builds upon the previous without merging back to main.
